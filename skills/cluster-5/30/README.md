### Summary

This skill involved getting our car to drive in various directions. We built the circuit as per the instructions in the repository. From this, we defined our pins accordingly and made forward, left, right, reverse, and stop functions for the car by adjusting the duty cycle and by turning certain motors on/off for turning (e.g. left motor off to turn left). To reverse, we had to swap the inputs on each motor. The video below shows our car driving!

### Evidence of Completion

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
