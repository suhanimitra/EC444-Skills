#  IR TX/RX

### Summary

This skill invovled wiring a circuit to build an IR receiver and emitter. I did this following the diagram in the repo. Then, I modified the code to send the current LED status when the button was pushed (as a sender). I also modified the code so to change the LEDs based on what color it received (as a receiver).

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
