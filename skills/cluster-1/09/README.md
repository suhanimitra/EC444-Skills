### Summary

This skill invovled using a photocell to detect environment light. To do this, I used a voltage divider circiut with a 10k ohm resistor in series with the photocell. I used the provided code to read the photocell output voltage. I demonstrated functionality by tracking the voltage in different lighting conditions and reported the value back in lux. We can see the lux change accordingly with documented lux [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux). 

### Evidence of Completion

- [Link to video of photocell in daylight/flashlight/covered](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rMfqdxcE9qpun1DrvaSTsPYn5OLoUn9X/view?usp=drive_link).

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
