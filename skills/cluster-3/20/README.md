### Summary

This skill was about connecting our ESP32 to WiFi, specifically through our router. To do so, I flashed the provided code on my ESP32. Before that, I ensured that the menu configuration contained the correct SSID and password as per our settings. My ESP32 successfully connected as it was then visible in the device list page of our router (see images).
