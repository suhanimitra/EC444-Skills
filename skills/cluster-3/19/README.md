# Dynamic DNS

Author: Suhani Mitra

Date: 2024-10-11

### Summary

This skill was about linking a dynamic DNS to our router. To do so, we used noip.com to create a dynamic DNS hostname/link. We integrated this in with our router and ensured they were connected. Then, we set up port forwarding from an internal address to a local host that we opened up on a browser, in our case port 3000. We also pinged the DDNS hostname and successfully received bytes.
