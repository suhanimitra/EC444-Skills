### Summary

This skill involved utilizing the Pi camera. To test, first I ran a simple hello-world to ensure the camera was functioning properly. Then, I opened a network on my local VLC app (my laptop) using the Pi's IP address and port number (3333) I specified when running "libcamera-vid -t 0 --inline --listen -o" on the pi (through SSH). The image/video below shows that the camera successfully works!
