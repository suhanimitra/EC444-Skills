#  Client and Server UDP with ESP32 and Node.js

Author: Suhani Mitra

Date: 2024-10-19

### Summary

This skill involved designing a node.js as a UDP server and client, and the ESP32 as the opposite. For the first part (ESP32 client, node server), I brough up the given code on the ESP32 and connected it using my laptop's IP address and an aribtrary port. I used the same IP/port combination on the node server and had the server respond to the client's new blink time. The first video demonstrates how the blink time toggles between 1000 ms and 500 ms.

We do the opposite for a ESP32 server and node client. This time we use the ESP32 IP and again an arbitary port. The video below demonstrates the LED toggling by the node client's request.
