# Code Readme

I have included code from the provided 04-Code-Examples/serial-esp-to-node-serialport and 04-Code-Examples/serial-canvas directories which include a node directory and an ESP directory. I also used code from my team's quest-1 to assist with the two sensor readings. I used code from cluster-2/16 and cluster-2/17 to help with node and CanvasJS.
