### Summary

This skill aimed to create a cloud storage location for class video recordings. To demonstrate functionality I created a short video introduction, stored this in my Google Drive folder, and included the link here on the README file.

### Evidence of Completion

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
