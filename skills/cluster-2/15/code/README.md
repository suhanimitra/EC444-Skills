# Code Readme

The template code in this folder is from 04-Code-Examples/i2c-accel. I also used some AI-generated code (see comments). Information for tilt sensing calcuations was gathere from this website: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/How_to_Use_a_Three-Axis_Accelerometer_for_Tilt_Sensing, which I used to guide my calcRP function.
