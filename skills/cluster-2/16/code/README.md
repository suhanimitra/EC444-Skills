# Code Readme

The main file in this directory was drawn from the esp/esp-idf/examples code. It assists in documenting ADC voltage reading. I have also taken code from the GitHub sample code (EC444 repository) to assist with this. This is essentially incorporated code from cluster-01/07 to aid with voltage reading.

I have also included code from the provided 04-Code-Examples/serial-esp-to-node-serialport directory which includes a node directory and an ESP directory.
